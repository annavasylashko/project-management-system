# Project management system

:bar_chart:**Projecto** is a web-based application used as a visual work management tool.

Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them.<br/>
Columns include task statuses such as To Do, In Progress, Testing and Done.

The greatest advantage of this application is it's suitability for personal usage. Most of management systems are targeted on big corporations leading to exessive amount tools making the environment not friendly for simple users.
